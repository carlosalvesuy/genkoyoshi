Genkō yōshi

Genkō yōshi (原稿用紙), also romanized at genkoyoshi, is a type of Japanese
paper used for writing. It is printed with squares. There are typically 200 or
400 squares on each sheet. Each square designed to accommodate a single
Japanese character or punctuation mark.

There are lots of PDFs available online but sometimes the squares are too big
or too small, the page size is wrong, etc.
